Postman Collection for the Nasuni NMC API

## Intro

## Usage

To use this postman collection you can either download or clone the repository to your local computer and import the folder or files or you can import directly from the GitHub Repo.

### Import Folder / Files

If you choose to import from folder or files you will need to first download a zip of the repo, or clone it to your local machine. Next, in Postman, click the "Import" button at the top of the screen. Select "File" or "Folder" at the top, and then browse to where you saved the repo files. Select them, and click Import. The collection should now appear on the left side of your screen under Collections.

### Import from Code Repository

In Postman, click "Import" at the top left. Then click "Code repository". Next you will need to connect Postman to your GitHub account. Once you have connected to your account, you will need to select which repository the collection is in. Note: If you have many repos it may not be listed, you can manually enter the name though.

Once you have the repo selected or manually entered, you will need to select the branch you want it to work from then click Continue. You will then be asked if you want to import the Collection and the Environment.
